# DermisMaturation
CC3D model of the mouse dermis

Code for the CC3D model described in the publication [**Fibroblast state switching orchestrates dermal maturation and wound healing**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/18/236232). In brief, a cellular Potts model was implemented using the CompuCell3D platform (Swat et al., 2012). The Glazier Graner Hogeweg/Cellular Potts Model (GGH/CPM) represents a single cell as an extended domain of sites (pixels) on a regular lattice that share a common index Ïƒ. For detailed information about GGH/CPM see (Belmonte et al., 2016; Swat et al., 2012). Cells in this model are represented as connected domains on a grid with the cell-free area represented as a special domain. Chemoattractant concentrations are represented on the same grid. Cell dynamics result from a series of attempts to expand the domains at randomly selected grid sites. Whether an expansion attempt is accepted or not depends on a set of rules, which thus determine cell dynamics. Simulations represent a 3D section of mouse skin. Fibroblasts are initialized as 10 cells disposed radially in contact with the epidermis (wall boundary conditions) and surrounding the body cavity (lumen). Built-in routines were used for the implementation of chemotaxis and secretion. Lumen and epidermal integrity, cell divisions, cell differentiation, cell fate conversion and wound healing were implemented as custom steppables.
